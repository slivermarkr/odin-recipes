        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the sticky rice balls by adding 1 cup of water to 2 cups glutinous rice flour. Mix with a fork until it forms a dough. Scoop about half a spoon of the dough and form them into balls using your palms. Set them aside.</li>
            <li>In a pot, combine 2 cups water, coconut milk, and sugar and bring to boil. Add the sweet potato cubes and cook for about 3 minutes stirring occasionally. Next, add the plantain banana cubes and cook for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the sweet potatoes and bananas are almost cooked, add the sticky rice balls and let simmer until they are cooked (about 5 minutes) while stirring occasionally. You know the sticky balls are done when they are floating.</li>
            <li>Add the jackfruit slices and the cooked tapioca pearls. Let simmer for another 3-5 minutes or until all fruits are tender and cooked.</li>
            <li>Note that it will continue to thicken even after removing it from the heat. Serve hot or cold.</li>
